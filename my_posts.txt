 is starting a campaiggn with 
@KodiakFi
(yes, you heard that right!!!)on 
@berachain
:
               this week's focus is on content about Amy and Kodiak
               another one is Amy × Kodiak Perps Season
               runs alongside Kodiak’s December perps competition
               from now to 31 December

price action is not that important when you're building, that's why I will focus on that for the next period
rebuilt the 
@avax
 memecoin launcher to be the most affordable on the chain, and I've got a very good domain for it: http://avaxfun.net

exited for the next period, no time to cry or play the victim
